# Transport demand prediction
### Description of the Problem

This challenge asks you to build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, i.e. for a specific route on a specific date and time. There are 14 routes in this dataset. All of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.

The towns from which these routes originate are:

Awendo Homa Bay Kehancha Kendu Bay Keroka Keumbu Kijauri Kisii Mbita Migori Ndhiwa Nyachenge Oyugis Rodi Rongo Sirare Sori

The routes from these 14 origins to the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi takes approximately 8 to 9 hours from time of departure. From the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi into the main bus terminal, where most passengers get off, in Central Business District, takes another 2 to 3 hours depending on traffic.

The three stops that all these routes make in Nairobi (in order) are:

Kawangware: the first stop in the outskirts of Nairobi Westlands Afya Centre: the main bus terminal where most passengers disembark All of these points are mapped here.

Passengers of these bus (or shuttle) rides are affected by Nairobi traffic not only during their ride into the city, but from there they must continue their journey to their final destination in Nairobi wherever that may be. Traffic can act as a deterrent for those who have the option to avoid buses that arrive in Nairobi during peak traffic hours. On the other hand, traffic may be an indication for peopleâ€™s movement patterns, reflecting business hours, cultural events, political events, and holidays.

This is all for you to explore in the data.
